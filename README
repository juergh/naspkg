Collection of APKG-like packages for the DNS-323
------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the source code and build environment to build a bunch
of APKG-like packages for the DNS-323. APKG-like because they're not packaged in
D-Link's proprietary APKG format but are mere tarballs. These tarballs can be
installed in the same location as the official APKGs. There are two different
types of packages: runable and shared. The shared packages provide binaries
and libraries and modules that the runable packages depend on. The runable
packages are the packages that actually provide the real services and can be
started/stopped through the GUI. If you install a package, make sure you also
install all its requirements.


Prerequisites
-------------

You need an ARM cross-compilation toolchain in order to compile the
packages. You can get one from https://github.com/juergh/toolchain_arm or use
your own.


Compile the packages
--------------------

$ git clone git@github.com:juergh/naspkg.git
$ cd naspkg/packages
$ make

This will build all packages. The packages are named <NAME>-<VERSION>.tgz and
are located in the individual subdirectories. There are also
<NAME>-<VERSION>.info files which are basically changelogs for the individual
packages.

Note: If you want the latest and greatest, checkout the develop branch.


Install the packages
--------------------

Assuming your DNS-323 is NFS mounted at /mnt/auto/dns-323, run the following
command to install a package:

$ tar -C /mnt/auto/dns-323/Nas_Prog -xzvf <package tgz>

Reboot the DNS-323 for the firmware to pick up the new package. This is only
required if you install a runable package.

Note that shared packages are all installed under Nas_Prog/shared, whereas
runable packages are installed directly under Nas_Prog. I.e., the directoy tree
might look like the following:

Nas_Prog
  |- shared
  |    |- busybox
  |    |- sudo
  |    \- (other shared packages)
  |- utelnetd
  |- dropbear
  \- (other runable packages)


Configure the packages
----------------------

For runable (non-shared) packages, the DNS web GUI can be used to start/stop
the package. Navigate to "Advanced" -> "Add-Ons" and you should see a list of
installed packages and start/stop action buttons.

Debug the packages
------------------

All packages from this repo write some form of logging data to a central
logfile named log in the Nas_Prog directory -> Nas_Prog/log. All errors that
are encountered during starting/stopping/running should get logged there.

Remove the packages
-------------------

Removal through the web GUI is not supported. Just remove the package
directory under the Nas_Prog directory and reboot the DNS.

TODO

- Support package removals through the web GUI
